/*
 * The boolean type represents a logical quantity with two possible values, indicated
by the literals true and false 

The boolean operators are:
• The relational operators == and != 
• The logical complement operator ! 
• The logical operators &, ^, and | 
• The conditional-and and conditional-or operators && and || 
• The conditional operator ? : 
• The string concatenation operator + 

Boolean expressions determine the control flow in several kinds of statements:

• The if statement (§14.9)
• The while statement (§14.12)
• The do statement (§14.13)
• The for statement (§14.14)
