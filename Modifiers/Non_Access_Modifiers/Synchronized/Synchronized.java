/*                                                  The Synchronized Keyword

    Simply put, in a multi-threaded environment, a race condition occurs when two or more threads attempt to update
        mutable shared data at the same time. Java offers a mechanism to avoid race conditions by synchronizing thread
        access to shared data.

    A piece of logic marked with synchronized becomes a synchronized block, allowing only one thread to execute at any
        given time.

                                       We can use the synchronized keyword on different levels:

             * Instance methods
             * Static methods
             * Code blocks
