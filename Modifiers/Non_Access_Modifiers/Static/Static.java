       Static variables	and	methods	are
       	   class level variables and methods.
       There is	only one copy of the static variable for the entire	Class.
       Each	instance	of	the	Class	(object)	will	NOT	have	a	unique	copy	of	a	static
           variable.

       Static methods cannot be overridden
       Cannot declare static variable in a method
       From a static method can access only static variable
       From a member level method (instance method) can access static and instance variable

       Static methods and variable are at class level methods or variable and not created for every instance of a class
       but are created to be shared of all instances of a class
