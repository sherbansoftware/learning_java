/*
    I within the lambda expression in any local variable we want to use from the enclosing block has to be effectively
    final for the same reason that
        local variables have to be declared final
        if we want to use them within an anonymous classes code by effectively final I mean that the variable has to
        be either declared final or it's value must never change

    when working with lambda is just imagine the code is enclosed within curly braces
