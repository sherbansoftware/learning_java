    ○ as the name implies,

                   * are references to constructors,

                   * and they are also assigned to Functional Interfaces.

    ○ are used for

                   * constructing objects

           because they are references to constructors and that's what constructors do.



    ○ Constructor References,

                   * we have the ClassName

                   * followed by two semicolons

                   * followed by the new keyword.
