    ○ matching & finding

                  * MATCH operations will just check if the stream elements match given predicate.

                                - so the return boolean value.

                  * SEARCH operations return an element matching certain criteria.

     ○ reduction

                  * reduction operations are used to reduce the extreme elements into a single value by using:

                                - reduce() or it's special cases:



                  * Then we reduce operations and reduce operations repetitively, apply a binary operation on
                        those elements.

           - A binary operation would be used and that would be applied repetitively on the elements.

      ○ collect

            - collect operations are used to produce an output like a list or a set RMI.
