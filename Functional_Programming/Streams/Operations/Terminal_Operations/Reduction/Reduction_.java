/*                                       Reduction operations


    ○ Reduction operations can be classified into two types,

                  * reduce() method      -- IMMUTABLE reduction , reduce stream into a single value: min, max, sum

                       or it's special cases:

                                - average,
                                - sum,
                                - min,
                                - max,
                                - count
                                - summaryStatistics()

                  * collect() method      -- MUTABLE reduction ,reduce stream into a container: list,set, map,object

    ○ The JDK also contains reduction operations that return a collection instead of a single value.
      Many reduction operations perform a specific task, such as

                  * finding the average of values
                  * or grouping elements into categories.
