            ○ maxBy()

            ○ summingInt()

            ○ averagingInt()

            ○ summarizingInt()

            ○ joining()


    ○  in case if these methods do not satisfy your requirement, then you can implement a collector by yourself,
            so we can

                  * implement the collector interface, and we can implement our own collector.
