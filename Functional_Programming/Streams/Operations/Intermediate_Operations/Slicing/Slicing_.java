/*                                                Slicing a Stream


  ○ The slicing operations are intermediate operations,and we are going to look at three operations that fall under
        the slicing operations, and they are:

                * distinct

                * limit

                * skip.

    ○ Slicing operations, as the name implies, are used to slice the stream just like the way we slice a pizza.

       This way we are able to focus on only a particular part of the stream.
