/*                               Stream<T>	distinct()


    ○ Returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements (according to Object.equals(Object)) of this stream.

    ○ For

                  * ordered streams,

                               - the selection of distinct elements is stable (for duplicated elements, the element
                                     appearing first in the encounter order is preserved.)

                  * unordered streams,

                                - no stability guarantees are made.
