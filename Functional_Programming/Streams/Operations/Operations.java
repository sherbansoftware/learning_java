/*                                                        Stream Operations


    ○ Intermediate operations:

                  * filtering

                             - Predicate like parameter

                  * mapping

                             - Function like parameter

                  * slicing

                            - slicing can be considered as a special type of filtering operations as they also allow
                                  only certain elements of the stream to be processed.

    ○ Terminal operations:

                  * matching & finding

                           - Match operations will just check if the

                                     • stream elements match given predicate.
                                           So the return boolean value.

                           - Search operations return an element matching certain criteria.

                  * reduction

                           - reduction operations are used to reduce the extreme elements into a single value.

                           -Then we reduce operations and reduce operations repetitively, apply a binary operation on
                                those elements.

                           - A binary operation would be used and that would be applied repetitively on the elements.

                  * collect

                           - collect operations are used to produce an output like a list or a set RMI.
