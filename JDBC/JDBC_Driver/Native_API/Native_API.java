/*                                          Native API driver

    ?   uses the client-side libraries of the database.
            The driver converts

                        * JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API.

                    It is not written entirely in java.


                                                      Advantage:

    ? performance upgraded than JDBC-ODBC bridge driver.

                                                      Disadvantage:

    ?The Native driver needs to be installed on the each client machine.

    ? The Vendor client library needs to be installed on client machine.
