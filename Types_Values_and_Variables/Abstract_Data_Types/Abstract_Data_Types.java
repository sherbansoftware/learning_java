/*                                        Abstract  Data Types

    Doesn't dictate how the data is organized
    Dictates the operations you can perform
    Concrete data structure is usually a concrete class
    Abstract data type is usually an interface
    Abstract data type is more about behaviour and what operations you can do.
    So in the case of lists, any class that implements the list interface, is a list and so you could have a class that
        uses an array for the list.


                                                      NOTE

            * Now in Java, a concrete data structure like an array is usually a class.
                  Arrays might actually be an exception to that.
