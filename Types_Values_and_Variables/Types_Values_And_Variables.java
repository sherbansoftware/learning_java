/*                                             Types, Values, and Variables

    The Java programming language is a :

         statically typed language

              which means that every variable and every expression has a type that is known at compile time.

        a strongly typed language

             because types limit the values that a variable (§4.12) can hold or that an expression can produce, limit the
             operations supported on those values, and determine the meaning of the operations. Strong static typing helps
             detect errors at compile time.

    The types of the Java programming language are divided into two categories:

        primitive types
        reference types.


     The primitive types (§4.2) are

             boolean type
             numeric types

                 The numeric types are:

                     byte
                     char
                     short
                     int
                     long
                     float
                     double

      The reference types (§4.3) are:

                   class
                   interface
                   array
                   null

          An object (§4.3.1) is a dynamically created instance of a class type or a dynamically created array. The values
              of a reference type are references to objects. All objects, including arrays, support the methods of class
              Object (§4.3.2). String literals are represented by String objects (§4.3.3).
