    â—‹ The strong reference is the most common type of Reference that we use in our day to day programming:

                   * Integer prime = 1;

           The variable prime has a

                   * STRONG reference to an Integer object with value 1.

           Any object which has a strong reference pointing to it

                   * is not eligible for GC.
