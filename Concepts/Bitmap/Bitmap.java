/*                                                       Bitmap in Java


    â—‹ is a MAPPING from

                   * one system such as integers

                   * to bits.

           It is also known as

                   * Bitmap index

                   * or a Bit array.

           The memory is divided into units for bitmap. These units may range:

                   * from a few bytes

                   * to several kilobytes.

           Each memory unit is associated with a bit in the bitmap.
