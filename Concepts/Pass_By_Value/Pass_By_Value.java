/*                          Java always passes parameter variables by value.

    Object variables in Java always point to the real object in the memory heap.

        A mutable object's value can be changed when it is passed to a method.
        An immutable object's value cannot be changed, even if it is passed a new value

                               Passing by value

    means passing a copy of the argument and not the original argument

                                Passing by reference

    means to pass a reference to the original object or the original variable
