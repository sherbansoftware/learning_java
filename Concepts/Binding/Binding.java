/*                                                   Binding means


    ○ an association

                  * of method call

                  * to the method definition.

     ○ The picture below clearly shows what is binding.


                                                 There are two types of Binding:

    ○ Static

    ○ and Dynamic Binding in Java.


            If the compiler maps the method at compile-time, it is Static Binding or early binding.
