      1. Platform Independence

                    * build once, run anywhere

      2. Object-Oriented Language

   
    ○ Once we compile a java program and build a jar,

                    * we can run the jar (compiled Java program) in any Operating System

                                  - where a JVM is installed.

              Java achieves Platform Independence in a beautiful way.

    ○ On compiling a java file the output is a class file

                    * which contains an internal java representation called bytecode.

            JVM converts bytecode to executable instructions.

       The  executable  instructions  are  different  in  different  operating  systems.  So,  there  are  different
           JVM's  for  different  operating  systems.

       A  JVM  for  windows  is  different  from  a  JVM  for  mac. However,  both  the  JVM's  understand  the
           bytecode  and  convert  it  to  the  executable  code  for  the respective operating system.


                                         What is ByteCode?

    ○ Java bytecode is

                   * the instruction set of the Java virtual machine.

           Each bytecode is composed of

                    * one, or in some cases two bytes that represent the instruction (opcode),
                          along with zero or more bytes for passing parameters.
