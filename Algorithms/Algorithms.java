    An algorithm describes the steps you have to perform to accomplish a specific task.

                                                 Java Sorting Algorithms

    Quick Sort
        Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm, which means original array is divided into two arrays, each of them
        is sorted individually and then sorted output is merged to produce the sorted array.

    Merge Sort
        is used when the data structure doesn't support random access, since it works with pure sequential access
        (forward iterators, rather than random access iterators). It?s also widely used for external sorting, where
        random access can be very, very expensive compared to sequential access.

    Bubble Sort
        is a simple and slow sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the collection, compares each
        pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

    Selection Sort
        is a simple and slow sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the lowest or highest element from
        the un-sorted section and moves it to the end of the sorted section.

    Insertion Sort
        is a simple and slow sorting algorithm that repeatedly takes the next element from the un-sorted
        section and inserts it into the sorted section at the correct position.

                                                      NOTE

            * An algorithm is not an implementation, they're not the same thing.

                  An algorithm:
                      describes the steps you have to perform,

                  and implementation
                      is the code you write to perform those steps if we're talking about programming.

                   There can be many implementations of the same algorithm.
