/*                                              Polymorphism in Java

    is the ability of an object to take many forms. To simply put, polymorphism in java allows us to perform the same
    action in many different ways. Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic
    and in java, all the java objects are polymorphic as it has passed the IS-A test for their own type and for the class
    Object. There are two types of polymorphism in java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.

    This article also talks about two types of polymorphism in Java:

            * compile-time polymorphism
            * runtime polymorphism,


    Polymorphism is a feature of the object-oriented programming language, Java, which allows a single task to be
        performed in different ways. In the technical world, polymorphism in java allows one to do multiple implementations
        by defining one interface.
