/*                                                           Data Hiding

    ○ Data hiding is a technique specifically used in object oriented programming to

                   * hide the internal object details.

           That is data members or the data component.

    ○ That means any outsider or unauthenticated user should not access our internal data.

       Data the just basic to application of program or to any authenticated user should not be accessed by
           anyone without any validation.

    ○  For example to access Google account:

        We need to provide proper

                    * username
                    * and password

            Only after passing or completing this validation process we can access our account.
