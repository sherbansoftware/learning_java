/*                                              Abstraction in Java


    ○ Abstraction is a process of:

                   * hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

    Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending SMS
        where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
        Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.

   ○ There are two levels of abstraction (two ways to achieve abstraction) in Java:

                  * Interface (100%), used to define expected behaviour
                  * Abstract Classes (0 to 100%), used to define incomplete functionality.

   ○ Abstraction is one of the four major concepts behind object-oriented programming (OOP) which permit to

                  *  Avoid repetitive code
                  * Presents only the signature of internal functionality
                  * Gives flexibility to programmers to change the implementation of the abstract behaviour
