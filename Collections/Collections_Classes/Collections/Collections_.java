    public class Collections_Class extends Object

    This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return collections. It contains polymorphic
        algorithms that operate on collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a specified collection,
        and a few other odds and ends.
    The methods of this class all throw a NullPointerException if the collections or class objects provided to them are null.
