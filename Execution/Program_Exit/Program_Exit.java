/*                                                        Program Exit

    A program terminates all its activity and exits when
        one of two things happens:

             * All the threads that are not daemon threads terminate.

             * Some thread invokes the exit method of class Runtime or class System, and the exit operation is not
                   forbidden by the security manager.
