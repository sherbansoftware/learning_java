    ○ public class Throwable extends Object implements Serializable

    ○ The Throwable class is the superclass of:

                   * Error

                                 - So error is basically anything that programmer can never be able to handle.

                   * Exception

                                 - those things that programmer can do something about.

                                       so you can probably read.

            classes in the Java language.

   ○ Only objects that are

                   * instances of this class (or one of its subclasses) are thrown by the Java Virtual Machine

                   * or can be thrown by the Java throw statement.

  ○ Similarly,

                    * only this class or one of its subclasses

                   * can be the argument type in a catch clause.
