/*                                             Simple Queue

    A queue is an object (an abstract data structure - ADT)

    In a simple queue,

        insertion takes place at the rear
        and removal occurs at the front. It strictly follows the FIFO (First in First out) rule.

    Basic Operations of Queue

        Enqueue:
            Add an element to the end of the queue
        Dequeue:
            Remove an element from the front of the queue
        IsEmpty:
            Check if the queue is empty
        IsFull:
            Check if the queue is full
        Peek:
            Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it

                                                           NOTE
