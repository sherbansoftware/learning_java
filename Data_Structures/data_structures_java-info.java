                                         Data Structures in Java

     A data structure is a way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
     It provides a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently. And efficient data structures are key to
     designing efficient algorithms.

                                         Linear Data Structures in Java

     Linear data structures in Java are those whose elements are sequential and ordered in a way so that: there is only
     one first element and has only one next element, there is only one last element and has only one previous element,
     while all other elements have a next and a previous element.
