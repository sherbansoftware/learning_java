    Generics trees are a collection of nodes where each node :
        is a data structure that consists of records and a list of references to its children(duplicate references are
        not allowed).Unlike the linked list, each node stores the address of multiple nodes.Every node stores address of
        its children and the very first nodeï¿½s address will be stored in a:
            separate pointer called root.

   The Generics trees are the N-ary trees which have the following properties:

            1. Many children at every node.

            2. The number of nodes for each node is not known in advance.
