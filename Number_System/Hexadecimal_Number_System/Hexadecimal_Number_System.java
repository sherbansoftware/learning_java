/*                                       Hexadecimal Number System


    ○ It is also pronounced sometimes as 'hex'.

    ○ Hexadecimal numbers are represented by only 16 symbols. These symbols or values are

                  * 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.

           Each digit represents a decimal value. For example, D is equal to base-10 13.

     ○ In mathematics and computing, the hexadecimal (also base 16 or simply hex) numeral system is a positional numeral
            system that represents numbers using a

                   * radix (base) of 16.

    ○ Software developers and system designers widely use hexadecimal numbers

                   * because they provide a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values.

            Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble).

            For example,

                   * an 8-bit byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form,

                   * which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.
