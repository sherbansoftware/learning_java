/*                                      Decimal numeral system(number system)


    ○ For writing numbers, the decimal system uses

                  * ten decimal digits,

                  * a decimal mark,

                  * and, for negative numbers, a minus sign "−".

          The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;
          The decimal separator is

                  * the dot "." in many countries (mostly English-speaking),

                  *  and a comma "," in other countries.
