/*                                                Java Reflection


    ○ Java Reflection is a

                   * powerful language

                   * and JVM feature

           that gives us

                   * runtime access to information about our applications

                                 - classes

                                 - and objects.

    ○ Those features are available to us through the reflection API which is a set of

                    * classes

                    * and methods

            it comes with every JDK.


                                             What we can do with Java Reflection?


    ○ Using Java reflection API we can write flexible code that

                * Links different software components together at runtime

                * Creates a new program flow without making any source code modifications

                * Reflection also allows us to write extremely powerful

                              * general-purpose algorithms

                       that dynamically

                               * adapt

                               * and change

                       their behavior based on the type of objects or classes they are working on.


                                                       NOTE


            * With the ability to analyze our application's objects and classes at runtime
                  and use that as an input

                      We can create very powerful

                              * libraries
                              * Frameworks
                              * Software Designs

                       that  would otherwise be impossible to create

             * Popular Java Reflection Use Cases(Frameworks):

                           - JUnit which is the standard framework for Unit Testing of Java Applications

                           - Dependency Injection

                                     Spring/Spring Boot
                                     Google Guice

                           - JSON Serialization/deserialization

                                     Jackson
                                     Gson

                           - Logging frameworks
                           - ORM (Object- Relational Mapping) tools
                           - Web Frameworks
                           - Developer tools
                           - Many more...

              * We can use Reflection for architecting our own applications and libraries and augment them with unique

                            - functionality
                            - and features

              * The greatest challenge of using Java reflection comes from its ability to

                            - do very powerful things

                            - and even get access to internal and hidden structures

              * Java Reflections Challenges:

                    If used incorrectly or not for the right purpose where is making our code

                             - Harder to maintain
                             - Slower to run
                             - and in some cases even dangerous to execute

                         as reflection code has the potential to crash our application unrecoverable so as the saying

                            - goes with great power

                            - comes great responsibility

                     and that is why reflection is often reserved for skilled developers who have a strong grasp of the
                         java language
