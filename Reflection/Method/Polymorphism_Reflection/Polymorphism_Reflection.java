/*                  Method implementing polymorphism using java reflections


    â—‹ What happens if those two classes belong to entirely SEPARATE libraries and therefore DO NOT

                  * implement

                  * or inherit

          from a SHARED interface or class furthermore, what if the names of the methods are not even the same
          we still use polymorphism and group objects of those classes in a similar way without reflection?

       The answer is no

                   * but because all classes in java

                             - INHERIT from the Object class

                             - and thanks to java reflection features

                       we can achieve a SIMILAR functionality to POLYMORPHISM
