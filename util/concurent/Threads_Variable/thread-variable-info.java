/*                              Thread stack memory

         said that every thread has a thread stack and that's memory that only that thread can access
         when multiple threads are working with the same object they inf act share the same object or share that object
         so they don't have their own copy as such and so when one thread changes the value of one of the objects instance
         variables the other threads will see the new value from that point forward
