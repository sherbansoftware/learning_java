/*                                                 RMI

    ○ The RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is an API that provides a mechanism to

                  * create distributed application in java.

          The RMI allows an object to invoke methods on an object running in another JVM.

    ○ The RMI provides REMOTE communication between the applications using two objects:

                   * stub

                   * and skeleton.


                                       Distributed applications


    ○ Distributed applications can be relatively simple, requiring a

                  * single client computer

                  * and a single server,

          or more complex, allowing

                  * many client computers

                  * and several servers.

          For example, web browsers are distributed applications
