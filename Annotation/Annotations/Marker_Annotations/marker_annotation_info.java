package Annotation.Annotations.Marker_Annotations;

//A marker annotation is a shorthand designed for use with marker annotation types(ยง9.6.1).

 /*

     MarkerAnnotation:       @TypeName

    It is shorthand for the normal annotation:    @TypeName()

     It is legal to use marker annotations for annotation types with elements,so long as all the elements have default
         values(ยง9.6.2).



        EXAMPLE:


    @Preliminary
    public class TimeTravel { ...
    }
