/*   An annotation is a marker which associates information with a program construct,but has no effect at run time.


    An annotation denotes a specific invocation of an annotation type(§9.6)and usually provides values for the elements
        of that type.

   There are three kinds of annotations.The first kind is the most general,while the other kinds are merely shorthands
       for the first kind.

        Annotation:

        NormalAnnotation
        MarkerAnnotation
        SingleElementAnnotation


        Normal annotations are described in §9.7.1,marker annotations in §9.7.2,and single element annotations in
        §9.7.3.Annotations may appear at various syntactic locations in a program,as described in §9.7.4.The number of
        annotations of the same type that may appear at a location is determined by their type,as described in §9.7.5.
