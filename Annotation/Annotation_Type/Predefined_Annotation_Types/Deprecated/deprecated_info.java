/*

  @Deprecated annotation indicates that the marked element is deprecated and should no longer be used.The compiler
 generates a warning whenever a program uses a method,class,or field with the@Deprecated annotation.When an element is
 deprecated,it should also be documented using the Javadoc@deprecated tag,as shown in the following example.The use of
 the at sign(@)in both Javadoc comments and in annotations is not coincidental:they are related conceptually.Also,note
 that the Javadoc tag starts with a lowercase d and the annotation starts with an uppercase D.

// Javadoc comment follows

   @deprecated explanation of why it was deprecated
