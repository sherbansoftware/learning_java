    â—‹ The frequency and disjoint algorithms test some aspect of the composition of one or more Collections_:

                  * frequency

                                 - counts the number of times the specified element occurs in the specified collection

                  * disjoint

                                 - determines whether two Collections are disjoint;

                                 - that is, whether they contain no elements in common
