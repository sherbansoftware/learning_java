                                           The polymorphic algorithms


    ○ described here are pieces of reusable functionality provided by the Java platform.

    ○  All of them

                    * come from the  Collections class,

                    * and all take the form of static methods whose first argument is the collection on which the
                          operation is to be performed.

            The great majority of the algorithms provided by the Java platform operate on List instances,

                    * but a few of them operate on arbitrary Collection instances.

    ○ This section briefly describes the following algorithms:

                  * Sorting

                  * Shuffling

                  * Routine Data Manipulation

                  * Searching

                  * Composition

                  * Finding Extreme Values
