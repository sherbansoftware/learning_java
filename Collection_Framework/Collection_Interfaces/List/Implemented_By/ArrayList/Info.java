                                                       NOTE

            * ArrayList is a resizable or growable array
            * The underlying data structure for a realist class is an Array_.
            * Allow duplicate elements
            * In ArrayList order is preserved (ordered collections)
            * Accept heterogeneous objects
            * Default size of a ArrayList is 10 and after you will try to add an element after actual size it will grow
                  with formula (x *3/2) +1 where x is initial size
