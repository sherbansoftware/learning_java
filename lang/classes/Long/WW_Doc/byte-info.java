/*                                                  Class Long

    java.lang.lang.classes.Object

            java.lang.Long

            All Implemented Interface_Class:  Serializable, Comparable<Long>

    public final class Long  extends Number implements Comparable<Long>

        The Long class wraps a value of the primitive type long in an object. An object of type Long contains a single
            field whose type is long.
        In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a long to a String and a String to a long, as
            well as other constants and methods useful when dealing with a long.

    Implementation note:
        The implementations of the "bit twiddling" methods (such as highestOneBit and numberOfTrailingZeros) are based
        on material from Henry S. Warren, Jr.'s Hacker's Delight, (Addison Wesley, 2002).

    Since:
        JDK1.0
