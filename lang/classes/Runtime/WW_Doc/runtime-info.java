/*                                  Class Runtime

    java.lang.Object
        java.lang.Runtime

                           public class Runtime extends Object

    Every Java application has a single instance of class Runtime that allows the application to interface with the environment
        in which the application is running. The current runtime can be obtained from the getRuntime method.

    An application cannot create its own instance of this class.

    Since:
        JDK1.0

    See Also:
        getRuntime()
