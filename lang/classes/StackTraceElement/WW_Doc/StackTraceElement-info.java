    All Implemented Interface_Class: Serializable

                    public final class StackTraceElement extends Object implements Serializable

    An element in a stack trace, as returned by Throwable.getStackTrace(). Each element represents a single stack frame.
        All stack frames except for the one at the top of the stack represent a method invocation. The frame at the top
        of the stack represents the execution point at which the stack trace was generated.
    Typically, this is the point at which the throwable corresponding to the stack trace was created.
