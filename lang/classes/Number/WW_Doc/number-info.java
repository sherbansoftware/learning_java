    public abstract class Number extends lang.classes.Object implements Serializable

    The abstract class Number is the superclass of platform classes representing numeric values that are convertible to
        the primitive types byte, double, float, int, long, and short. The specific semantics of the conversion from the
        numeric value of a particular Number implementation to a given primitive type is defined by the Number
        implementation in question. For platform classes, the conversion is often analogous to a narrowing primitive
        conversion or a widening primitive conversion as defining in The Java™ Language Specification for converting
        between primitive types. Therefore, conversions may lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric
        value, may lose precision, and may even return a result of a different sign than the input. See the documentation
        of a given Number implementation for conversion details.
