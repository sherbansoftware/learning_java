/*                public final class Float extends Number implements Comparable<Float>

    The Float class wraps a value of primitive type float in an object. An object of type Float contains a single field
        whose type is float.
    In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a float to a String and a String to a float, as well
        as other constants and methods useful when dealing with a float.
