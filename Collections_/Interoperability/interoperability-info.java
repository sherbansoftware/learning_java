    Interoperability tells you how the Collections_ Framework interoperates with older APIs that predate the addition of
        Collections_ to Java. Also, it tells you how to design new APIs so that they'll interoperate seamlessly with other
        new APIs.


               • Compatibility: This subsection describes how collections can be made to work with older APIs that predate
                   the addition of Collections_ to the Java platform.

               • API Design: This subsection describes how to design new APIs so that they will interoperate seamlessly
                   with one another.
