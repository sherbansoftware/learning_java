                                           The polymorphic algorithms

          described here are pieces of reusable functionality provided by the Java platform. All of them come from the
          Collections_ class, and all take the form of static methods whose first argument is the collection on which the
          operation is to be performed. The great majority of the algorithms provided by the Java platform operate on
          List instances, but a few of them operate on arbitrary Collection instances. This section briefly describes
          the following algorithms:

              Sorting
              Shuffling
              Routine Data Manipulation
              Searching
              Composition
              Finding Extreme Values
