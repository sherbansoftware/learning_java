                                             The shuffle algorithm

    does the opposite of what sort does, destroying any trace of order that may have been present in a List. That is,
    this algorithm reorders the List based on input from a source of randomness such that all possible permutations occur
    with equal likelihood, assuming a fair source of randomness. This algorithm is useful in implementing games of chance.
    For example, it could be used to shuffle a List of Card objects representing a deck. Also, it's useful for generating
    test cases.

       This operation has two forms: -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          one
              takes a List and uses a default source of randomness
         and the other
              requires the caller to provide a Random object to use as a source of randomness. The code for this
              algorithm is used as an example in the List section.
