                                                   Finding Extreme Values

    The min and the max algorithms return, respectively, the minimum and maximum element contained in a specified Collection.
    Both of these operations come in two forms. The simple form takes only a Collection and returns the minimum (or maximum)
    element according to the elements' natural ordering. The second form takes a Comparator in addition to the Collection
    and returns the minimum (or maximum) element according to the specified Comparator.
