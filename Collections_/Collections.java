/*                                              Collection

      A collection  sometimes called a container is simply an object that groups multiple elements into a single unit.
      Collections_ are used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.
      It looks like arrays but collections are more advanced and more flexible. An array simply stores a fixed number
          of objects, whereas a collection stores objects dynamically, i.e. you can add or remove objects as you wish.

                                             Java Collections_ Framework.

       A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections.
       In short, Java Collections_ Framework is a set of reusable data structures and algorithms which are designed to free
           programmers from implementing data structures themselves so that they can focus on business logics.
       The Java Collections_ Framework provides common data structures implementations which are enough for general-purpose
           such as list, set, map, queue, tree, etc. These collections are high-performance, high-quality, and easy to use
           with very good documentation.
      In addition, the Java Collections_ Framework provides useful and robust algorithms such as searching and sorting on
          collections, and the interoperability between collections and arrays.

                                               Why Use Java Collections_ Framework?

    The Java Collections_ Framework is a standard API which is used extensively in Java programming. It’s the standard
        and perfect API for manipulating collections because of the following primary benefits:

            * Reduce programming effort: with the reusable and useful data structures and algorithms, the programmers do
                  not have to re-invent the wheel, thus they can devote their time on developing application’s business.

            * Increase program speed and quality: the concrete collections implemented by Java Collections_ Framework are
                  built for high performance and high quality, thus programmers can take this advantage into their programs.

            * Foster software reuse: due to the Java Collections_ Framework is built into the JDK, code written using
                  collections framework can be re-used every where among applications, libraries and APIs. That cuts
                  development cost and increases interoperability among Java programs.


       You'll learn about the core elements interfaces, implementations, aggregate operations, and algorithms
       that comprise the Java Collections_ Framework.

      Introduction------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         tells you what collections are, and how they'll make your job easier and your programs better.
         You'll learn about the core elements that comprise the Collections_ Framework:

                 * interfaces,
                 * implementations
                 * and algorithms.

      Interface_Class--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         describes the core collection interfaces, which are the heart and soul of the Java Collections_ Framework. You'll learn
         general guidelines for effective use of these interfaces, including when to use which interface. You'll also learn
         idioms for each interface that will help you get the most out of the interfaces.

      Aggregate Operations----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         iterate over collections on your behalf, which enable you to write more concise and efficient code that process
         elements stored in collections.

      Implementations--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         describes the JDK's general-purpose collection implementations and tells you when to use which implementation.
         You'll also learn about the wrapper implementations, which add functionality to general-purpose implementations

      Algorithms--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         describes the polymorphic algorithms provided by the JDK to operate on collections. With any luck you'll never
         have to write your own sort routine again!

      Custom Implementations--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         tells you why you might want to write your own collection implementation (instead of using one of the general-purpose
         implementations provided by the JDK), and how you'd go about it. It's easy with the JDK's abstract collection
         implementations!

      Interoperability -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         tells you how the Collections_ Framework interoperates with older APIs that predate the addition of Collections_ to Java.
         Also, it tells you how to design new APIs so that they'll interoperate seamlessly with other new APIs.
