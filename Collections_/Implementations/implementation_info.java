    https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/implementations/index.html

    Implementations describes the JDK's general-purpose collection implementations and tells you when to use which
        implementation. You'll also learn about the wrapper implementations, which add functionality to general-purpose
        implementations.
