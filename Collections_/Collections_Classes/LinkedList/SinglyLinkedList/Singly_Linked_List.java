/*                                                         Singly linked list

    Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure.
    Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

    A singly linked list is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction
        from head to the last node (tail).

    Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains

            * data
            * and a pointer to the next node

    which helps in maintaining the structure of the list.

    The first node is called

            * the head;

     it points to the first node of the list and helps us access every other element in the list

     The last node, also sometimes called

             * the tail,

     points to NULL which helps us in determining when the list ends.



                                                              NOTE

           * The worst case Time Complexity for performing these operations is as follows:

              Add a node to the List:

                 - Add item to the front of the list: O(1)
                 - Add item to the end of the list: O(n)
                 - Add item to anywhere in the list: O(n)

              Remove a node from the list:

           * The worst case Time Complexity for performing this operation is as follows:

                  - Remove item from the front of the list: O(1)
                  - Remove item from the end of the list: O(n)
                  - Remove item from anywhere in the list: O(n)
