https://tutorialspoint.dev/language/java/concurrentskiplistset-in-java-with-examples



    The ConcurrentSkipListSet class in Java is a part of the Java Collection Framework and implements the Collection
        interface and the AbstractSet class. It provides a scalable and concurrent version of NavigableSet in Java.
        The implementation of ConcurrentSkipListSet is based on ConcurrentSkipListMap. The elements in ConcurrentSkipListSet
        are sorted by default in their natural ordering.
