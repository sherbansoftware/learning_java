/*                                                Concurrency

    In a real application, Threads normally need to interact with one another

            • Shared Objects or Messaging Queues

    • Issues:

            • Race Condition
            • DeadLock and more

    • Tools to handle these issues:

        • Synchronized Statements/Methods
        • Reentrant Locks, Semaphores
        • Concurrent Collections
        • Conditional Objects and More

              Concurrency                                         vs                        Parallelism

    • Concurrency is a concept where two                                    • Parallelism is a concept where two
      or more tasks can run simultaneously                                   or more tasks are literally running in parallel

     • Concurrency can be implemented in                                    • Parallelism can only be implemented
       single or multiple cores                                               in a multi-core machine

     • Concurrency is about correctly and                                    • Parallelism is about using more
       efficiently controlling access to                                       resources to access the result faster
       shared resources
