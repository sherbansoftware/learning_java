        Latency
            - the time to completion of a task.Measured in time units


        Throughput(Debit)
            - is the amount of tasks completed in a given period of time and is measured in tasks per unit of time.

    These are completely independent metrics and improving one may have no impact on the other, or even sometimes having
        a diverse effect on the other.

                                          Hyperthreading

     most computers today use what's called hyper-threading.

     It means that a single physical core can run two threads at the time that is achieved by having some hardware units
         in a physical core duplicated.

            * Virtual Core1
            * and Virtual core 2
