/*                                                 Parallelism

     is a concept, in which tasks are literally going to run in parallel.

     Parallelism involves these following steps,

            1. decomposing the task into multiple subtasks SubTasks(Forking)

            2.executing these tasks in sequential

            3. joining the results of these individual tasks into a single result.

        This whole process is also known as Fork/Join

              Concurrency                                         vs                        Parallelism

    • Concurrency is a concept where two                                    • Parallelism is a concept where two
      or more tasks can run in  simultaneously                                or more tasks are literally running in parallel

     • Concurrency can be implemented in                                    • Parallelism can only be implemented
       single or multiple cores                                               in a multi-core machine

     • Concurrency is about correctly and                                    • Parallelism is about using more
       efficiently controlling access to                                       resources to access the result faster
       shared resources
