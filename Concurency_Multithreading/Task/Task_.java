    A task is an object that represents some work that should be done.
        The task can tell you if the work is completed and if the operation returns a result,
        the task gives you the result.

                                                       Type of Tasks

    Type1 - Parallelizable Tasks

            * tasks that are inherently paralyzable and can be easily broken into sub tasks.

    Type2 -The unbreakable tasks

            * that we're just forced to run on a single thread

     Type3 - Partially broken into subtask

           * and partially we have to run sequentially.
