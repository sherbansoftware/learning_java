/*                                          Instance Fields(Instance variable)

    Instance variable in Java is used by Objects to store their states. Variables that are defined without the STATIC
        keyword and are Outside any method declaration are Object-specific and are known as instance variables. They are
        called so because their values are instance-specific and are not shared among instances.
    If a class has an instance variable, then a new instance variable is created and initialized to a default value as
        part of the object creation of the class or subclass.

                                              Rules for Instance variable in Java

        * Instance variables can use any of the four access levels
        * They can be marked final
        * They can be marked transient


        * They cannot be marked abstract
        * They cannot be marked synchronized
        * They cannot be marked strictfp
        * They cannot be marked, native
        * They cannot be marked static
