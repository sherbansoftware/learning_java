    A class declaration specifies a new named reference type.
    There are two kinds of class declarations:

            * normal class declarations
            * enum declarations.

    NormalClassDeclaration:

            {ClassModifier} class Identifier [TypeParameters] [Superclass] [Superinterfaces] ClassBody

    EnumDeclaration

            {ClassModifier} enum Identifier [Superinterfaces] EnumBody

                                                       NOTE

            * The Identifier in a class declaration specifies the name of the class.

            * It is a compile-time error if a class has the same simple name as any of its enclosing classes or interfaces.

            * The scope and shadowing of a class declaration is specified in :
