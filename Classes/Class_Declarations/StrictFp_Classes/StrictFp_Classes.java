/*                                             strictfp Classes

    The effect of the strictfp modifier is to make all float or double expressions within the class declaration
        (including within variable initializers, instance initializers, static initializers, and constructors) be explicitly
        FP-strict (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.4).

    This implies that all methods declared in the class, and all nested types declared in the class, are implicitly strictfp.

                                                    NOTE
