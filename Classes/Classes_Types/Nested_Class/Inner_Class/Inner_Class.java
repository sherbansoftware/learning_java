/*                                              Inner class


    ? The classes that are non-static and nested are called inner classes.


                                             There are two types of nested classes:


    ? non-static (inner class):

                  * Member inner class
                  * Anonymous inner class
                  * Local inner class

    ? Static nested classes:


                                            Advantage of java inner classes


    ? Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is

                   * it can access all the members (data members and methods) of outer class including private.

     ? Nested classes are used to develop more READABLE and MAINTAINABLE code because

                   * it logically groups classes and interfaces in one place only.

    ? Code Optimization:

                   * it requires less code to write.


                                                    NOTE


            * Inner class or nested class is a class that is declared inside the class or interface and is not static.

            * it can access all the members of the outer class, including private data members and methods.
                  It makes the program simple and concise.

            * We cannot create an instance of the inner class without creating an instance of the outer class.

            * We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place to be more readable and maintainable.

            * Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.
