/*                                              Inner class

    The classes that are non-static and nested are called inner classes.

                                             There are two types of nested classes:

            non-static (inner class)

                * Member inner class
                * Anonymous inner class
                * Local inner class

            static nested classes

                                            Advantage of java inner classes

        1) Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it can access all the members (data members and methods)
        of outer class including private.

        2) Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and
        interfaces in one place only.

        3) Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.

                                                    NOTE

            * Inner class or nested class is a class that is declared inside the class or interface and is not static.

            * it can access all the members of the outer class, including private data members and methods.
                  It makes the program simple and concise.

            * We cannot create an instance of the inner class without creating an instance of the outer class.

            * We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place to be more readable and maintainable.

            * Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.
