{InterfaceModifier} interface Identifier [TypeParameters] [ExtendsInterfaces] InterfaceBody

    The Identifier in an interface declaration specifies the name of the interface.

    It is a compile-time error if an interface has the same simple name as any of its enclosing classes or interfaces.

    The scope and shadowing of an interface declaration is specified in ยง6.3 and ยง6.4.
