                 Now Java has actually got 50 reserved words that are used for keywords in your applications.

                                              Expressions

                A Java expression consists of variables, operators, literals, and method calls.
                 For example:
                 number1 == number2 is an expression that returns a boolean value. ...
                 "Number 1 is larger than number 2" is a string expression.
