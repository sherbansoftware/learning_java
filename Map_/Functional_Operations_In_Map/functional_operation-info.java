                                       Functional Operations in Java Map

    The Java Map interface had a few functional operations added from Java 8. These functional operations make it
    possible to interact with a Map in a more functional style. For instance, you pass a Java Lambda Expression as
    parameter to these functional style methods. You can read more about functional programming in my tutorial about
    Java Functional Programming .

    The functional operation methods are:

        compute()
        computeIfAbsent()
        computeIfPresent()
        merge()
