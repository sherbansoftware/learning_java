/*                                   Treap Tree

    ATest.A treap is a binary search tree where each node is assigned a random numeric priority, and the nodes are in heap
    order with respect to those priorities. Two properties are guaranteed:

    The binary search tree property on the keys.
    The max heap property on the priorities. Every node n must have a greater priority than its children.
