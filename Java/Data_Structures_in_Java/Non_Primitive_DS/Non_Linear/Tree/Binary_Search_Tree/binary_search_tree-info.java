/*                                                       Binary Search Trees

    is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

        • The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
        • The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
        • The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
