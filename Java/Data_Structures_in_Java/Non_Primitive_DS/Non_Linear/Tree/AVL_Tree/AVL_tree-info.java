/*                                                 AVL Tree

    AVL Tree is invented by GM Adelson - Velsky and EM Landis in 1962. The tree is named AVL in honour of its inventors.

    AVL Tree can be defined as:
        height balanced binary search tree in which each node is associated with a balance factor
        which is calculated by subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from that of its left sub-tree.

     Tree is said to be balanced if balance factor of each node is in between -1 to 1, otherwise,
     the tree will be unbalanced and need to be balanced.


                            Balance Factor (k) = height (left(k)) - height (right(k))
