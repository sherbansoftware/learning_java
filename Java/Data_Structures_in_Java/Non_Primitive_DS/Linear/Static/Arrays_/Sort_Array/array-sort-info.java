                                            Sort An Array

      Using For Loops:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                     You can use for loops to traverse the array and compare adjacent elements while traversing and
                     putting them in order.

      Using The Sort method:
                    The Arrays class of  ‘java.util’ package provides the sort method that takes an array as an
                     argument and sorts the array. This is a direct sorting method and you can sort an array with
                     just one method call.
