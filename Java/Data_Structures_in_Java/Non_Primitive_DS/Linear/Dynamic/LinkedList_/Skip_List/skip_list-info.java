          is a probabilistic data structure. The skip list is used to store a sorted list of elements or data with a linked list.
          It allows the process of the elements or data to view efficiently. In one single step, it skips several elements of
          the entire list, which is why it is known as a skip list.
          The skip list is an extended version of the linked list. It allows the user to search, remove, and insert the element
          very quickly. It consists of a base list that includes a set of elements which maintains the link hierarchy of the
          subsequent elements.
