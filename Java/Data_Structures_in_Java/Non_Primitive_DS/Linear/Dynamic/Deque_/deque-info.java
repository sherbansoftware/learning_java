    Deque or Double Ended Queue is a type of queue in which insertion and removal of elements can be performed from either
    from the front or rear.
        Thus, it does not follow FIFO rule (First In First Out).

    Types of Deque:

       1. Input Restricted Deque:
            In this deque, input is restricted at a single end but allows deletion at both the ends.

       2. Output Restricted Deque
            In this deque, output is restricted at a single end but allows insertion at both the ends.

        Time Complexity

             constant   O(1).

    Applications of Deque Data Structure

    • In undo operations on software.
    • To store history in browsers.
    • For implementing both stacks and queues.
