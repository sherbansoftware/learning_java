    Coupling is a measure of how much a class is dependent on other classes.There should minimal dependencies between classes.
    So, we should always aim for low coupling between classes.

    In object oriented design, Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge that one element has of another.
    In other words, how often do changes in class ATest.A force related changes in class ATest.B.

    Tight coupling ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        When an object creates the object to be used, then it is a tight coupling situation. As the main object creates
        the object itself, this object can not be changed from outside world easily marked it as tightly coupled objects.

    Loose coupling -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        When an object gets the object to be used from the outside, then it is a loose coupling situation. As the main
        object is merely using the object, this object can be changed from the outside world easily marked it as loosely
        coupled objects.
