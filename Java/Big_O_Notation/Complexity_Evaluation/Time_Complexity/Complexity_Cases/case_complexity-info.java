/*                                        Complexity Cases

    Best-case complexity ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Worst-Case-Complexity ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1.We always look for the worst case time complexity, as algorithm will take no longer than this time to execute
       for any imput

   2.To make things easier we do not write "Worst case time complexity" but rather just complexity

   3.It mean that if we were asked to evaluate the algorithm complexity and there is no any explicit specification
       then you're asked to evaluate worst case time complexity.
