/*                                        Time complexity

    Time complexity in the amount of time required for the algorithm to complete.

    Time complexity is a function that represents dependency between:
         input data size
         and number of processor operations required for the algorithm to complete

                              T(N) = dependency_formula         where N is size of input data

                                     Algorithm Running Time Evaluation

    Any algorithm consist of indivisible processor operations(also called steps), that take the same time to execute
    It allows us to speak about algorithm running time in terms of
        process operations and not in terms of seconds.

    These type of measurement is called
        Deep Time simply time formally speaking does time represent
            the norm of computation steps that a computer would take to solve a certain computational problem using a
            set and all the runtime or algorithm.

                                         Time Complexity as Dependency

    The runtime or algorithm depends on the input parameters.
