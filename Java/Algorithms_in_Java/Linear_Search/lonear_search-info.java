/*                       Linear Search

    In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list.It
    sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched


    Complexity evaluation:

        Worst-case performance	          O(n)     (Good)
        Best-case performance	          O(1)     (Excellent)
        Average performance	              O(n/2)   (Excellent)

        Worst-case space complexity       O(1) iterative
