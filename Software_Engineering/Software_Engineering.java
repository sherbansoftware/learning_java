/*                              What is Software Engineering?


    ? The term “Software engineering” is composed of two words, software and engineering. In computing,

                   * The SOFTWARE is:

                             - a PROGRAM or SET OF PROGRAMS containing instructions especially designed to accomplish
                                   a specific task.

                    * Essentially, ENGINEERING is:

                              - the PROCESS of

                                    • designing,

                                    • building,

                                    • and testing something (like machines, processes, structures, etc.)

                            to serve a specific purpose and solve a problem in a cost-effective manner.

    ? Software Engineering entails

                  * understanding and analyzing user requirements,

                  * then designing,

                  * developing,

                  * and testing software applications to meet those needs using scientific

                            - principles,

                            - procedures

                            - and methods.

    ? Ultimately, software engineering results in an:

                   * effective,

                   * reliable,

                   * and high-quality software product that meets user requirements.

           Those who create such software applications are known as

                   * SOFTWARE ENGINEERS or DEVELOPERS.

    ? SOME ENGINEERS develop software applications for:

                   * clients

                   * and companies

           after analyzing the users’ requirements,

    ?  OTHERS develop the system software for:

                   * running devices

                   * and controlling networks.

           Organizations and businesses employ it for the development of larger and more complex software systems.
