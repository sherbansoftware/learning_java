/*                                       Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)


    ○ is an application programming interface (API) for the programming language Java, which defines

                   * how a client may

           access a database. It is a Java-based data access technology used for Java database connectivity. It is part
           of the Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation.


                                   We can use JDBC API to handle database using Java program


    ○ and can perform the following activities:

                    * Connect to the database

                    * Execute queries and update statements to the database

                    * Retrieve the result received from the database.

    ○ It uses concepts like Statement, PreparedStatement and ResultSet

    ○ It uses query to interrogate DB

    ○ Results from the query are populated into the ResultSet.
          We have to write code to liquidate the ResultSet into object


                                                    NOTE
