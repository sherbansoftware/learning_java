/*                                                   JDBC-ODBC bridge driver

    ? The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver uses

                   * ODBC driver to connect to the database.

           The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver converts

                   * JDBC method calls into the ODBC function calls.

               This is now discouraged because of thin driver.


                                             NOTE

        * In Java 8, the JDBC-ODBC Bridge has been removed.
