/*                                                 Thin driver

    ? The thin driver converts

                   * JDBC calls directly into the vendor-specific database protocol.

           That is why it is known as thin driver. It is fully written in Java language.


                                                      Advantage:

    ? Better performance than all other drivers.
    ? No software is required at client side or server side.

                                                   Disadvantage:

    ? Drivers depend on the Database.
