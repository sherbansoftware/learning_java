    ○ Spring Data JPA, part of the larger Spring Data family,

                  * makes it easy to easily implement JPA based repositories.

          This module deals with enhanced support for JPA based data access layers.

    ○ It makes it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use data access technologies.

    ○ Implementing a data access layer of an application has been cumbersome for quite a while.

    ○ Too much boilerplate code has to be written to execute simple queries as well as perform pagination,

           and auditing.

    ○ Spring Data JPA aims to

                  * significantly improve the implementation of data access layers

                  * by reducing the effort to the amount that’s actually needed.

          As a developer you write your

                  * repository interfaces, including custom finder methods,

                  * and Spring will provide the implementation automatically.


                                                         Features


    ○ Sophisticated support

                 * to build repositories based on Spring and JPA

    ○ Support

                 * for Querydsl (http://querydsl.com/) predicates

                 * and thus type-safe JPA queries

    ○ Transparent auditing of domain class

    ○ Pagination support, dynamic query execution, ability to integrate custom data access code

    ○ Validation of @Query annotated queries at bootstrap time

    ○ Support for XML based entity mapping

    ○ JavaConfig based repository configuration

                * by introducing @EnableJpaRepositories


                                                  Operations in Spring Data JPA


    ○ Now we would want to

                * add

                * delete

                * retrieve

                * update

                * and all sorts of operations .

    ○ How can we do them in Spring Data JPA?

    ○ The way you can do that is

               * by using something called a REPOSITORY.

    ○ A repository allows you to perform actions on entities.
