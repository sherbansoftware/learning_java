    ○ Classes for matching character sequences against patterns specified by regular expressions.

    ○ An instance of the Pattern class represents

                   * a regular expression that is specified in string form in a syntax similar to that used by Perl.

    ○ Instances of the Matcher class

                   * are used to match character sequences against a given pattern.

           Input is provided to matchers

                   * via the CharSequence interface in order to support matching against characters
                         from a wide variety of input sources.

    ○ Unless otherwise noted,

                   * passing a null argument to a method in any class or interface in this package

                                 - will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.
