/*                                 In computer science, a memory leak


    ○ is a type of resource leak that occurs

                   * when a computer program incorrectly MANAGES memory allocations in a way that memory which is no
                         longer needed is not released.

                   * A memory leak may also happen when

                                 - an object is stored in memory

                                 - but cannot be accessed by the running code.

     ○ A memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems

                   * and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code.
