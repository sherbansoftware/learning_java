    One of the more confusing aspects when learning to program with generics is determining when to use an upper bounded
        wildcard and when to use a lower bounded wildcard. This page provides some guidelines to follow when designing
        your code.

    For purposes of this discussion, it is helpful to think of variables as providing one of two functions:

            An "In" Variable

    An "in" variable serves up data to the code. Imagine a copy method with two arguments: copy(src, dest). The src
        argument provides the data to be copied, so it is the "in" parameter.

            An "Out" Variable

    An "out" variable holds data for use elsewhere. In the copy example, copy(src, dest), the dest argument accepts data,
        so it is the "out" parameter.

    Of course, some variables are used both for "in" and "out" purposes â€” this scenario is also addressed in the guidelines.

    You can use the "in" and "out" principle when deciding whether to use a wildcard and what type of wildcard is appropriate.
        The following list provides the guidelines to follow:

    Wildcard Guidelines:

            * An "in" variable is defined with an upper bounded wildcard, using the extends keyword.
            * An "out" variable is defined with a lower bounded wildcard, using the super keyword.
            * In the case where the "in" variable can be accessed using methods defined in the Object class, use an
                unbounded wildcard.
            * In the case where the code needs to access the variable as both an "in" and an "out" variable, do not
                use a wildcard.
