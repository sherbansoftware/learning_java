                                    Formal methods

    In computer science, specifically software engineering and hardware engineering, formal methods are a particular kind
    of mathematically rigorous techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems.
    The use of formal methods for software and hardware design is motivated by the expectation that, as in other
    engineering disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysis can contribute to the
    reliability and robustness of a design.
