/*                                           An algorithm

          is a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem.
          The development and analysis of algorithms is fundamental to all aspects of computer science:
          artificial intelligence,
          databases,
          graphics,
          networking,
          operating systems,
          security, and so on.
          Algorithm development is more than just programming. It requires an understanding of the alternatives available
          for solving a computational problem, including the hardware, networking, programming language, and performance
          constraints that accompany any particular solution. It also requires understanding what it means for an algorithm
          to be “correct” in the sense that it fully and efficiently solves the problem at hand.

                                              Data structure

          is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification.
          More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions
          or operations that can be applied to the data.
