                                                             Data types

    Primitive types ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Boolean, true or false.
        Character
        Floating-point numbers, limited precision approximations of real number values.
            Including Single precision and Double precision IEEE 754 Floats, among others
        Fixed-point numbers
            Integer, integral or fixed-precision values.
        Reference (also called a pointer or handle), a small value referring to another object's address in memory,
            possibly a much larger one.
        Enumerated type, a small set of uniquely named values.
        Date Time, value referring to Date and Time

    Composite types or non-primitive type ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Array
            (as an example String which is an array of characters)
        Record
            (also called Associative array, Map, or structure)
        Union
            (Tagged union is a subset, also called variant, variant record, discriminated union, or disjoint union)

    Abstract data types ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Container
        List
        Tuple
        Multimap
        Set
        Multiset (bag)
        Stack
        Queue (example Priority queue)
        Double-ended queue
        Graph (example Tree, Heap)
