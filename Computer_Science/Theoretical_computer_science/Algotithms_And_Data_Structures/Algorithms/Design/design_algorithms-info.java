        refers to a method or a mathematical process for problem-solving and engineering algorithms. The design of algorithms
        is part of many solution theories of operation research, such as dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer.Techniques
        for designing and implementing algorithm designs are also called
        algorithm design patterns,
            with examples including the template method pattern and the decorator pattern.

        One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is :
           resource (run-time, memory usage) efficiency;
           the big O notation is used to describe e.g. an algorithm's run-time growth as the size its input increases.

        Typical steps in the development of algorithms:

        Problem definition
        Development of a model
        Specification of the algorithm
        Designing an algorithm
        Checking the correctness of the algorithm
        Analysis of algorithm
        Implementation of algorithm
        Program testing
        Documentation preparation[clarification needed]
