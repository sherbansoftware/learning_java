                                               Algorithmic efficiency

        In computer science, algorithmic efficiency is a property of an algorithm which relates to the number of computational
        resources used by the algorithm. An algorithm must be analyzed to determine its resource usage, and the efficiency
        of an algorithm can be measured based on the usage of different resources. Algorithmic efficiency can be thought
        of as analogous to engineering productivity for a repeating or continuous process.

        For maximum efficiency we wish to minimize resource usage.
    Different resources such as:
        time and space complexity
            cannot be compared directly, so which of two algorithms is considered to be more efficient often depends on which
            measure of efficiency is considered most important.
