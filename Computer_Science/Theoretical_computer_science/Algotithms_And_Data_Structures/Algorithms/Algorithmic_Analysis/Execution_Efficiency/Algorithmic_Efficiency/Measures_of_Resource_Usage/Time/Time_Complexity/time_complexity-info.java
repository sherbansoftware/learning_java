/*                                                      Time complexity

  is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.
  Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each
  elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary
  operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.

                                       each algorithm have the following running times:

        Worst-case time complexity (e.g., input elements in reversed order)
        Best-case time complexity (e.g., already sorted)
        verage-case time complexity (e.g., elements in random order)
