        In computer systems, an algorithm is basically an instance of logic written in software by software developers,
        to be effective for the intended "target" computer(s) to produce output from given (perhaps null) input.
        An optimal algorithm, even running in old hardware, would produce faster results than a non-optimal (higher time complexity)
        algorithm for the same purpose, running in more efficient hardware; that is why algorithms, like computer hardware,
        are considered technology.

                                              Computer systems

        ATest.A computer:
            is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically
            via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations,called programs.
            These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.

        ATest.A "complete" computer:
            including the hardware,
            the operating system (main software),
            and peripheral equipment required

            and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for
            a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

        Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple
        special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and
        computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones.
        The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.

                                                    Control system

        ATest.A control system manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems using control loops.
        It can range from a single home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large
        Industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines.
