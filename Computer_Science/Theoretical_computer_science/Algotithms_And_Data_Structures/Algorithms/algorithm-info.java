                                                      An algorithm

          is a specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem.
          The development and analysis of algorithms is fundamental to all aspects of computer science:
          artificial intelligence,
          databases,
          graphics,
          networking,
          operating systems,
          security, and so on.
          Algorithm development is more than just programming. It requires an understanding of the alternatives available
          for solving a computational problem, including the hardware, networking, programming language, and performance
          constraints that accompany any particular solution. It also requires understanding what it means for an algorithm
          to be �correct� in the sense that it fully and efficiently solves the problem at hand.
