        Most algorithms are intended to be implemented as computer programs. However, algorithms are also implemented by
        other means, such as in a biological neural network (for example, the human brain implementing arithmetic or an
        insect looking for food), in an electrical circuit, or in a mechanical device.

                                       Computer program

         ATest.A computer program is a collection of instructions that can be executed by a computer to perform a specific task.

         ATest.A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language. From the program in its
         human-readable form of source code, a compiler or assembler can derive machine codeï¿½a form consisting of instructions
         that the computer can directly execute.
         Alternatively, a computer program may be executed with the aid of an interpreter.
